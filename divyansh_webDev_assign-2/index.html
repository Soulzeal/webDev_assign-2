    <!-- What’s Box Model in CSS ? 
    answer- The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including
     borders, margin, padding, and the content itself. It is used to create the design and 
     layout of web pages. According to the CSS box model, the web browser supplies each element
      as a square prism -->

      <!--  What are the Different Types of Selectors in CSS & what are the advantages of them?
    answer- 1) Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
           2) Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
           3) Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
           4) Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
           5) Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value) -->

           <!-- What is VW/VH ?
        answer - VH stands for “viewport height”, which is the viewable screen’s height. 
        100VH would represent 100% of the viewport’s height, or the full height of the screen. 
        And of course, VW stands for “viewport width”, which is the viewable screen’s width.
         100VW would represent 100% of the viewport’s width, or the full width of the screen -->

         <!-- Whats difference between Inline, Inline Block and block ?
        answer - 1) inline
        Displays an element as an inline element. Any height and width properties will have no
         effect.
        2) inline-block
        Displays an element as an inline-level block container. You CAN set height and width 
        values. 
        3) block
        Check the length of the string. for eg - div , h1 , p , li , section-->

    <!-- How is Border-box different from Content Box?
    answer - 
    In the content box model, the content inside of element will have the same dimension
    as the element.
    In the border box model, the content's dimension has to subtract the border and padding from 
    the element's dimension -->

    <!--  What’s z-index and How does it Function ?
    answer - 
    Z Index ( z-index ) is a CSS property that defines the order of overlapping HTML elements.
    Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index.
    Note: Z index only works on positioned elements ( position:absolute , position:relative , 
    or position:fixed ). -->

    <!--  What’s Grid & Flex and difference between them?
    answer - 
    Grid is made for a two-dimensional layout while Flexbox is for one. This means Flexbox can
    work on either row or columns at a time, but Grids can work on both. Flexbox gives you more 
    flexibility while working on either element (row or column). HTML markup and CSS will be
    easy to manage in this type of scenario. -->

    <!-- Q.8 Difference between absolute and relative and sticky and fixed position explain with
    example.
    answer -  -->
    <div class="container">
        <div class="relative">Relative Position</div>
        <div class="absolute">Absolute Position</div>
        <div class="static">Static Position</div>
        <div class="fixed">Fixed Position</div>
